Ethan did most of the coding and I did most of the organization.

By organization, I refer to the placement and choice of images,
colors used, and general user interface and experience stuff.

I also planned out the prices for each item based on searches on
the interenet.

I did minor coding for additional things here and there but not a lot,
all updates shown in the gitkracken screenshot show the general
divison of work, although we sometimes worked together on the same
computer.
